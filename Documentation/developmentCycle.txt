When you want to start work on something:

1) Go to https://github.com/cprail1/PMRRM and click the "synch" button

2) Open GitHub desktop and do a pull from the remote repository

3) Start making changes


When you have something that you'd like to keep, even if it's an intermediate step

4) Commit the files with your changes, including a useful comment


When you're done for a while and want to publish your changes (which is would be good to do e.g. when you quit for the day)

5) Drop the changes on any files you changed inadvertently

6) Push to github

7) Email your co-developer(s) to make sure they hear about what you've changed
